# yeelight-cinema-go

change your yeelight color to the dominant color of your screen

## usage

```bash
yeelight-cinema-go -addr 192.168.1.1 -port 55443 -head 0
```

set -addr and -port according to your yeelight settings

set -head to the monitor you want to connect. 0 is the default monitor

I haven't tested this code because I wrote it for someone else, I don't have a yeelight device
